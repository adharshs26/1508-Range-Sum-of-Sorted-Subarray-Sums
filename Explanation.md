The code computes the sum of all numbers in a sorted list of sums of all non-empty continuous subarrays of a given array `nums`, between 1-based indices `left` and `right`. 
It first generates all possible subarray sums by iterating through every possible start and end index, then sorts these sums. 
It extracts the relevant portion of this sorted list (from index `left-1` to `right-1` in 0-based indexing), computes their total, and returns this sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.
